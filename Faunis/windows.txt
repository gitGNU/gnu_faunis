Line Feed Problem: If you can't read the various text files of Faunis because of line feeds shown incorrectly, try opening them with WordPad instead of Notepad.

To run:
Just execute the batch files "runServer.bat" and "runClient.bat".

Alternatively, execute these commands from the command prompt:
java -ea -cp ./bin/ client/Client
java -ea -cp ./bin/ server/MainServer

To compile:
javac -sourcepath ./src/ -cp ./bin/ -d ./bin/ ./src/client/Client.java
javac -sourcepath ./src/ -cp ./bin/ -d ./bin/ ./src/server/MainServer.java

Remember to have the path of javac.exe and java.exe in your PATH environment variable, otherwise the "javac" and "java" commands may not be recognised. For javac.exe, this might look like "C:\Program Files\Java\JDK 6\bin", though the exact path depends on where you installed the JDK.
