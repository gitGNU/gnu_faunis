Notes for Windows users
########################################

Line Feed Problem: If you can't read the various text files of Faunis because of line feeds shown incorrectly, try opening them with WordPad instead of Notepad.

Windows users without "eclipse" and "make" may execute these commands from the Makefile in the command prompt:
To compile:
javac -sourcepath ./src/ -cp ./bin/ -d ./bin/ ./src/client/Client.java
javac -sourcepath ./src/ -cp ./bin/ -d ./bin/ ./src/server/MainServer.java
To run:
java -ea -cp ./bin/ client/Client
java -ea -cp ./bin/ server/Server
Remember to put the path of javac.exe and java.exe in your PATH environment variable, otherwise the "javac" and "java" commands may not be recognised. For javac.exe, this might look like "C:\Program Files\Java\JDK 6\bin", though the exact path depends on where you installed the JDK.
